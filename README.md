# End-to-end-Credit-Card-Defaulter
Credit Card Defaulter Classifier project with Deployment

I used kaggle dataset to build machine learning classifer that classifies a person to a dafaulter or not. Then I deployed this as a web application using Flask framework

You can go and check the application with the link : http://creditcarddefaulter-env.eba-p2sm3r7m.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/
In this project I am going to take a machine learning approch to detect weather a person will be a defaulter or not. A person is said to be a Credit card defaulter if he fails to pay the Minimum Amount Due on the credit card for a few months. this project may help banks to predict if a person will be a defaulter or not so that they may know how much money are they going to collect this month.
